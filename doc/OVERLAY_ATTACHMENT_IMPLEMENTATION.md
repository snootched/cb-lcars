# Unified Overlay Attachment Point System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
We have successfully implemented a unified attachment point system that allows lines to attach to ANY overlay type, not just text overlays.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Infrastructure Changes

**AdvancedRenderer.js:**
- Added `overlayAttachmentPoints` map to replace text-only `textAttachmentPoints`
- Added `computeAttachmentPointsForType()` method that delegates to type-specific methods
- Updated `_buildDynamicOverlayAnchors()` to use unified attachment points
- Added individual `_compute*AttachmentPoints()` methods for each overlay type
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing text attachment points

**LineOverlayRenderer.js:**
- Updated `setOverlayAttachmentPoints()` method to accept unified attachment points
- Maintains backward compatibility by keeping `textAttachmentPoints` reference

### 2. Renderer-Specific Attachment Point Methods

Each overlay renderer now has a static `computeAttachmentPoints()` method:

**SparklineRenderer.js:**
- Computes attachment points based on position and size
- Returns 9 standard attachment points (center, corners, sides)

**HistoryBarRenderer.js:**
- Same as sparkline, using position/size configuration
- No DOM measurement needed (unlike text overlays)

**StatusGridRenderer.js:**
- Basic attachment points for the overall grid
- TODO: Future enhancement for individual cell attachment points

**MsdControlsRenderer.js:**
- Attachment points based on foreignObject position in SVG coordinate space
- Handles the special case of controls embedded in SVG

### 3. Validation System
- No changes needed to `validateMerged.js`
- Overlay IDs were already accepted as valid anchor targets
- The existing virtual anchor validation system now supports all overlay types

## Attachment Point Structure

Each overlay now provides these attachment points:
```javascript
{
  id: overlay.id,
  center: [centerX, centerY],
  bbox: { left, right, top, bottom, width, height, x, y },
  points: {
    center: [centerX, centerY],
    top: [centerX, top],
    bottom: [centerX, bottom],
    left: [left, centerY],
    right: [right, centerY],
    topLeft: [left, top],
    topRight: [right, top],
    bottomLeft: [left, bottom],
    bottomRight: [right, bottom],
    // Aliases
    'top-left': [left, top],
    'top-right': [right, top],
    'bottom-left': [left, bottom],
    'bottom-right': [right, bottom]
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

Now you can attach lines to any overlay type:

```yaml
overlays:
  - id: cpu_chart
    type: sparkline
    position: [100, 100]
    size: [200, 60]

  - id: memory_bars
    type: history_bar
    position: [400, 100]
    size: [300, 80]

  - id: status_display
    type: status_grid
    position: [100, 200]
    size: [150, 120]

  - id: power_button
    type: control
    position: [300, 250]
    size: [100, 80]

  # Lines can now attach to ANY overlay type
  - id: line_to_sparkline
    type: line
    anchor: [50, 130]
    attach_to: cpu_chart
    attach_side: left
    attach_gap: 10

  - id: line_sparkline_to_history
    type: line
    anchor: cpu_chart         # Start from one overlay
    attach_to: memory_bars    # End at another overlay
    attach_side: top-left

  - id: line_to_status_grid
    type: line
    anchor: memory_bars
    attach_to: status_display
    attach_side: right

  - id: line_to_control
    type: line
    anchor: status_display
    attach_to: power_button
    attach_side: bottom-right
    attach_gap: 5
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Consistency**: Any overlay can attach to any other overlay
2. **Unified API**: All renderers implement the same attachment point interface
3. **Future-Proof**: New overlay types automatically get attachment support
4. **Backward Compatible**: Existing text overlay attachments continue working
5. **Flexible Positioning**: Support for all 9 attachment sides on any overlay type

## Testing

The implementation can be tested with the configuration in `test_overlay_attachment.yaml` which demonstrates:
- Sparkline ← Line attachment
- History Bar ← Line attachment
- Status Grid ← Line attachment
- Control ← Line attachment
- Overlay → Overlay chaining (sparkline to history bar to status grid to control)

## Next Steps

1. Test the implementation with real configurations
2. Add individual grid cell attachment points to StatusGridRenderer
3. Consider adding attachment points for line overlays themselves (for line-to-line connections)
4. Add animation support for attachment point updates during dynamic changes
