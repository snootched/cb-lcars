/**
 * TEST CONFIGURATION FOR OVERLAY-TO-OVERLAY ATTACHMENT WITH SIDE CONTROL
 *
 * This demonstrates the new unified attachment point system with explicit side control:
 * - anchor_side: Controls which side of SOURCE overlay to attach from
 * - attach_side: Controls which side of TARGET overlay to attach to
 * - anchor_gap/attach_gap: Gap offsets from overlay edges
 *
 * Test Cases:
 * 1. Coordinate to overlay attachment (basic)
 * 2. Overlay to overlay with specific sides
 * 3. Chain of overlays with different sides
 * 4. Gap testing with various offsets
 *
 * Expected Behavior:
 * - Lines should NOT all connect to centers
 * - Each line should respect its anchor_side and attach_side settings
 * - Gaps should create visible offsets from overlay edges
 *
