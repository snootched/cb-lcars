/**
 * TEST CONFIGURATION FOR OVERLAY-TO-OVERLAY ATTACHMENT
 *
 * This demonstrates the new unified attachment point system:
 * - Sparkline can be attached to by lines
 * - History bars can be attached to by lines
 * - Status grids can be attached to by lines
 * - Controls can be attached to by lines
 * - Any overlay can attach to any other overlay
 *
 * Example configuration:
 *
 * overlays:
 *   - id: cpu_sparkline
 *     type: sparkline
 *     position: [100, 100]
 *     size: [200, 60]
 *     source: cpu_usage
 *
 *   - id: memory_history
 *     type: history_bar
 *     position: [400, 100]
 *     size: [300, 80]
 *     source: memory_usage
 *
 *   - id: system_status
 *     type: status_grid
 *     position: [100, 200]
 *     size: [150, 120]
 *
 *   - id: power_control
 *     type: control
 *     position: [300, 250]
 *     size: [100, 80]
 *     card:
 *       type: button
 *       entity: switch.main_power
 *
 *   - id: line_to_sparkline
 *     type: line
 *     anchor: [50, 130]  # Start point
 *     attach_to: cpu_sparkline  # Attach to sparkline
 *     attach_side: left
 *     attach_gap: 10
 *
 *   - id: line_sparkline_to_history
 *     type: line
 *     anchor: cpu_sparkline      # Start from sparkline
 *     attach_to: memory_history  # Attach to history bar
 *     attach_side: top-left
 *
 *   - id: line_to_status_grid
 *     type: line
 *     anchor: memory_history     # Start from history bar
 *     attach_to: system_status   # Attach to status grid
 *     attach_side: right
 *
 *   - id: line_to_control
 *     type: line
 *     anchor: system_status      # Start from status grid
 *     attach_to: power_control   # Attach to control
 *     attach_side: bottom-right
 *     attach_gap: 5
