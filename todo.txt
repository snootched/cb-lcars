todo:

-css on form
-versioning
  -set in code
  -set in gitb
  -yaml versioning and how to compare?  == or >
  ---update webpack into release (forgot to do it locally) then test the version compare

-move classes out to separate files
-move card registration info out into yaml?
-look at those event listeners on dom loaded





-figure out ha-lcars theme integration
-rename all the colors to --cblcars-<color>
--update all references in template code.  do --lcars* || --cblcars-*

think about a defaults system (save prefs in the dashboard?? could be nice to have per-dash configs)
color picker/settings manager??
view strategy for settings (or add to airlock?)
